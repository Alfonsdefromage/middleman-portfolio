      <h2>Kollab (airbnb clone)</h1>
      <h6>Role: Lead Developer</h5>
      <p> This was a one week group project where we had to build an airbnb clone.
        <br>
        My team decided to simulate a place where space owners - from Caf√©s which have an empty wall to share up to professional galleries - could rent out their spaces to artists.
        We came to the conclusion that, as an beginning artist without connections it's difficult to display art. Therefore the idea was born to create a space to encourage upcoming talents. </p>
