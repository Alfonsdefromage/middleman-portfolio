          <h2>Hi folks! 🙌</h2>
          <p>I'm Igor, originally from 🇵🇱 Poland, raised in 🇩🇪 Germany, and I’ve been living in 🇯🇵 Japan since 2018. Each year I find myself falling more in love with this country. 🌸</p>
          <p>In 2024, I completed a full stack web development bootcamp at Le Wagon Tokyo 🗼. The 9-week intensive course 🔥 ignited my passion for programming, and I've been fascinated by how a few lines of code can create endless possibilities, from interactive websites to data-driven applications. 👨‍💻</p>
          <p>When I’m not scanning my code for that one missing comma, I’m discovering Japan through my camera’s viewfinder 📷 or searching the nearby Hard-Off for treasures from my past.👾</p>
